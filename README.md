## Overview

`myTheme-v3` is a polished Hotspot theme for MikroTik RouterOS, designed to improve the user experience of captive portal pages (login, status, logout) while remaining lightweight and fully compatible with RouterOS Hotspot variables.

**Key goals:**
- Clean UI for faster login and better status visibility.
- Fully Customized portal (logo, brand colors, wording).
- Minimal dependencies and optimized assets for low-resource environments.

---

## Features

- ✅ Responsive layout for phones, tablets, and laptops  
- ✅ Works with default Hotspot templates (`login.html`, `status.html`, `logout.html`, etc.)  
- ✅ Customizable brand colors, fonts, and logos  
- ✅ Optional Terms of Service modal / page  
- ✅ Simple error handling and variable placeholders (e.g. `$(username)`, `$(host)`)  
- ✅ Lightweight CSS & JS with caching hints
- ✅ Background music for different occasions
- ✅ Well structured file hierarchy for easier management

> **Note:** Replace MikroTik placeholder variables carefully. Keep RouterOS Hotspot variable syntax intact (e.g., `$(mac)`, `$(ip)`, `$(username)`, etc.).
